# Useful Resrouces

## Mental Health, Self Improvement and Some Good Youtube Channels to Follow

- This is primarily written for guys as I (the human who created this repository) am a guy and have a limited experience of what issues bother girls and what kind of resources they would need to help them overcome this
- Here is a list of things which, I guess, every guy should watch once and learn from

1. [Full Self Improvement Guide: How To Fix Your Life As A Young Man](https://youtu.be/PYaixyrzDOk) : The 6th section is not entirely applicable in Indian society as people are generally reserved (this might be the exception in college though).
2. [Shwetabh Gangwar](https://www.youtube.com/c/ShwetabhGangwar1/featured) : His thinking process is brilliant. I highly encourage to check his channels. He talks about a wide range of topics.
3. [Anonymous - MESSAGE TO FUTURE GENERATIONS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfyxg9FUMZ8)
4. [Jordan Peterson](https://www.youtube.com/c/JordanPetersonVideos/videos) : A brilliant thinker of our modern times. He is a psychologist and has insightful comments about how society operates and how it affects individuals.

## Social Media Posts and Forums

- Subreddits : There is a subreddit for almost everything. I will be sharing the subreddits which I have stumbled across OR used myself. [Watch this video to know what is reddit and how to safely use it](https://youtu.be/bxekpNmEClU)
  > **DO NOT FORGET TO CHECK WIKI**. Almost each subreddit has a wiki or a collection of precompiled information. This is done so that information is not repeated (like a gym related sub will have resources which every beginner must see instead of asking "I am new. What to do?"
  - [Subreddit for resume review : r/resumes](https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/)
  - [Subreddit for Indian Developers : Useful for budding software engineers r/developersIndia](https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/)
  - [Subreddit for getting advice to pursue MS abroad : r/gradadmission](https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/)
