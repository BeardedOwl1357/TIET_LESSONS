## Workshops and Societies

- Mostly, lots of societies will have orientation events and workshops (Especially in first year)

  - There is no inherent benefit on being a part of society. No certificate from society OR any position of Head / Core member will get you placed.
  - However, you will be able to meet like minded (and non like minded) people, increasing your social circle and helping you realize what you like and don't
  - Also, being a part of events (and if you are willing, maybe even getting interested in departments like finances, sponsorships etc) will help you explore new things

- The biggest benefit of societies is the interaction with seniors.

  - Be respectful to them (no matter how chill they tell you to be). It is always a good idea to be respectful towards your seniors and batchmates.
  - Heck, if you are on good terms, you can even ask for referral someday

- Lots of workshops and events will be organized. Some will be overlapping and thus, you would need to choose which do you want to attend
  - Aim to attend as many workshops as possible (even if you have to attend alone. You cannot always do everything with your friends and that's completely alright)
  - There are a few workshops where no feasible learning would take place. Like a few hours session on ML (Machine Learning) or IOT (Internet of Things) will not teach you a lot. You can learn from the internet in an efficient way.
  - But, these workshops and events will allows you to have hands-on experiences and possibly guidance from seniors (And also, a chance to know other people)
  - Some workshops are also of non-technical skills (like public speaking or anything else). There is no harm in attending them.

## Scholarships and CGPA

- Your CGPA is literally your ticket to privleges in college
  - SGPA = Semester Grade Point Average : You get this every semester
  - CGPA = Cummulative Grade Point Average : Average of SGPA till current semster
- Some privleges are as follows

  1. `Scholarship` (After you get one, you need to maintain 8.5 SGPA in every semster) : Every term (year), you have the chance to get scholarships. In first year, you are given scholarships on basis of JEE ranks. For more info, refer to Thapar website
  2. `Hostel Choice` : Some "premier" (or in demand) hostels (like Hostel M and O for boys and Hostel `<fill this later>` for girls) are allocated on basis of CGPA. Higher your CGPA, higher your chance of getting your desired hostel
  3. `Placement Shortlisting` : Lower CGPA can make you miss out many opportunities as during placements, companies initially use a combination of CGPA,12th and 10th marks (not necessarily all 3 but CGPA is pretty much always used) to shortlist candidates to appear for the tests. Having a low CGPA means that you won't be able to sit for many companies even though you are highly skilled

- CGPA Calculation
  - An approximate calculation is `Sum(SGPA) / Number(Semsters)`
  - The actual calculation is given on the backpage of your gradecard
  - Each semester, the denominator (Number(Semesters)) increases therefore, it becomes difficult to get a good CGPA in later semesters

> **Advice : Focus on getting a good CGPA in first year (First 2 Semesters)**

- It is easy to get as you have just passed JEE and your basics are strong
- What you are being taught is not fundamentally different to what you have been studying
- In later semesters, the coursework becomes difficult and it becomes difficult to get good marks
- Also, your priorities start to change (instead of academics, you focus on other stuff)

## Miscellaneous Information

## General Placement Tips

- Resume is a subset of CV
  - CV = Summary of whatever you have done throughout your life
  - Resume = Parts of CV which are relevant about the job
- Tailor your resume for each job. Be sure to include keywords
- In candidate selection, the interviewer thinks along these lines `Hiring candidate having maximum experience in cheap`. So, they value experience (internships, hackathons, projects) more than your academics (**DO NOT SACRIFICE ACADEMICS FOR EXPERIENCE. SOME LEVEL OF ACADEMICS IS ALWAYS REQUIRED**)
- Positions of responsibility (like being Core member in a society or managing and organizing events / workshops) is a plus (especially for non-tech companies)
- For fresher, one page resume is preferred
- Avoid self flattering terms in resume as well as in interview. Be humble but confident (basically, not arrogant)
- `Tell me one skill where you would rate yourself 9/10`
  - Whatever the answer you give to this question will become the discussion topic. They aim to humiliate you and smash you down to bring out the "real" you.
  - Be really careful on what you say on this. Be confident that this is something where they can't beat you.
  - **it should be relevant to the job profile**
- Do not repeat content in resume
- If reading is put on as a hobby, then have 5 books in your mind with summaries
- `Should I include school level achievements in resume?`
  - If it is not something special (like state or national level in sports or olympiads), then don't otherwise yes
- Include projects in GitHub (or somewhere where you can display your work. Like a portfolio website or anything of that sort)
- `How to write a resume summary/ objective statement?`
  - Not necessary to write but If writing, it should match with job description (include keywords)
  - Keywords can be obtained either from job profile OR google (for example, google "Software engineering job keywords")
- `What are your weaknesses`? Ensure the following in your answer
  - The weakness does not put you in a negative spot : You need to present your weakness in such a way that it does not put you in bad spot BUT actually showcases your good qualities.
    - Example : `Weakness = erratic sleeping and waking up time. Explanation : Whenever I tend to work, I get in the zone and often lose track of time. This has resulted in me sleeping and waking up at erratic times.`.
    - In this, you are highligting the fact that you are a focused worker AND also highlighting that because of this focus, you have sleep schedule problems
  - The weakness which you are providing, is relevant to the job : You being weak in driving has nothing to do with your ability to code.
  - **Prepare answers of 3 such weaknesses**
