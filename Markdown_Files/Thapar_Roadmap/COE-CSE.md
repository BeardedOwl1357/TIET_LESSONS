## Overview

- These are the events which you will experience in 4 years of your engineering in COE (Computer Engineering) and CSE (Computer Science and Engineering)
  - There is no fundamental difference between the two branches
  - Only the order in which subjects are taught is different

| Year | Events                                                                                    |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Emphasis on all around education, basic programming, workshops, ELC's                     |
| 2    | Data Structure and Algorithms, Buggy Project, Essential Core Subjects                     |

| 4    | Placements, Some Core Subjects, Capstone Evaluations                                      |

## First Year

- All the engineering branches will be taught the same subjects in this year but in different order
- For example, the subjects which students of Non-CS branches (Civil,Mechanical, Chemical etc) will be studying in first semester will be the same subjects you will study in second semester

- **You are at a stage where exploration is your main goal**

  - There is no need to rush to "Get the 40 LPA package" as said by any random youtuber
  - Neither do you need to hustle for side income or do freelancing. ~~thand rak bc~~ Have some patience (unless your financial situation is really dire.)
  - Build your foundation, determine what excites you and work towards it

- Focus on your academics . [CGPA and Scholarships Section. (Click here)](../Thapar_Info.md#scholarships-and-cgpa)
- The "best friends" which you make in your first year will be nothing more than contacts in your second / third year
  - However, there are some exceptions
  - Cherish those exceptions
- Is it necessary to have friends? No. But, having them (even a few) definitely helps
  - Humans are social creatures (no matter how much of a loner you are. I (author) am a fellow loner too yet I have friends)
  - From a logical point of view, friends act as information bearers: You can get info from them and also learn from them
  - `The basis of friendship is mutual interest and benefit: Two people are friends only when their interests are mutual and both benefit from being friends. It is a symbiotic relationship.`
  - How to make friends: (I am the last person to suggest this but yeah, these are generic points)
    - Societies: There are lots of them. They will help you mingle with people who share common interests as societies are nothing more than a group of like-minded people doing something together
    - Workshops : Conducted by socities (especially in first year). You get to learn and in some cases, can organically foster friendships.
    - Also read [Societies and Workshops](../Thapar_Info.md#workshops-and-societies)
- Peer pressure is definitely a thing

  - Some cool people will attempt to make you "try out" stuff
  - Chances are, because of being afraid of social rejection, you will try it out and then develop a new addiction
  - Some might even use "YOLO" or "These things can only be done in college times"

    - A few quotes which can help you deal with peer pressure

      - > There is no greater validation to our ego than for someone to copy our ideas or behaviors. If a man wants to get drunk at a party, he will aggressively convince others to get drunk as well so that his drunkenness is validated and his conscience silenced (i.e., “Since everyone else is doing it, my drinking can’t be that bad”). Ironically, the people who are living the most sordid lives are most forceful in persuading others to do the same, because without social conformity, the truth of their sinful behavior would be too painful to bear, but it’s this persuasion that, like crabs in a bucket, drag others down into the abyss.

      - > I was reminded of this recently when trying to get rid of an ant infestation. My mother notified me that she had ants around her kitchen window. They didn’t seem to be doing any harm, and I wanted to let them be, but she insisted that they must be eliminated for her well-being. I bought an ant trap, placed it where the ants congregated, and waited. It didn’t take long for the first ant to come feed on the poison. Through his pheromonal faculty, he informed other ants of the “free food” and his brethren also came to feed. A grand feast ensued. Many ants took home “to-go” containers of poison to ensure that the entire hive was eliminated within only a couple of days, much to my mother’s joy.

      - > Secular people who live in sin, and who require constant social validation to soothe their conscience, behave like the doomed ants. They feast on sex, drugs, entertainment, travel, pop music, and other worldly behaviors, and then try to convince others with a loud voice to do the same to feel assured that their lifestyle is “normal” or “correct.” They think, “How can it be wrong if all my friends are doing it?”

  - So, what's the solution? Are you just supposed to study, get good grades, get a job etc? Yes and No
    - Yes : These things will make your life easy to live. With good grades, your college life will get easier and this will also make placements easy for you. When you have a good job in future, you will get money which will allow you to explore your life freely.
    - No : For short term, you need to relax and have fun. What alcohol, smoking, and drugs do is generate dopamine. There are definitely activites which can produce dopamine and also are healthy for you (interaction with others, anime, tv-shows, games, exercise, just walking, swimming etc).
      - > Note: keep everything in moderation and keep mixing stuff up. If you are a gamer, try some tv-shows or anime (and vice versa). If you are a gymmer, try swimming or just basic cardio. As they say, variety is the spice of life

## Second Year

- This year will primarily focus on building your funadmentals. You will be taught the foundational subjects in CS
  - Data Structures
  - Algorithms (Designa and Analysis of Algorithms)
  - Databases
  - Computer Networking
- Study them to the best of your ability and get good grades.
- To ensure that your DSA (Data Structure and Algorithm skills are good), focus on leetcode and other interview related questions
  - This is the best time to do it as you would be freshly learning this stuff
  - Don't just rely on professors. They cannot teach you how to solve DSA questions for interview. What they can teach is how these data structures work internally
  - **INTERNAL WORKING OF DATA STRUCTURES IS ESSENTIAL.** : Interviewers sometime discuss these internal specifics too. You need to know this too.
- Focus on your CGPA again.
- You might be tempted to start learning development related stuff. You can do it however if you utilise this year in getting good at DSA, then you can spend time giving leetcode contests in 3rd year and learning dev skills too

## Third Year

- **BUILD A RESUME**
  - Ask `CTD` (Centre for Training and Development)
  - It is near B-block
- You will be dealing with subjects which are not necessarily related to computer science but neverthless, important. Few examples
  - Software engineering : PLEASE LEARN AGILE. Almost every company follows agile workflow
  - Optimization Techniques : Difficult. In terms of coding, be good at matlab.
- Spend 5th semester for learning dev related skills as Software engineering defintiely has a project

  - Popular is MERN stack for webdev
  - If you know java, then you can learn java related dev stuff like Spring-Boot (some companies do use java for their codebase)
  - You can choose AI and ML however I would say that as a fresher, its not worth it. There is not a lot you can do at a bachelors level (for companies to hire you). However, you can give kaggle contests. There is a higher demand for masters in AI than for bachelors.
  - Learn from youtube or udemy. Both are good. There are shit tons of resources

> You will be getting chances for summer internships. SUMMER INTERNSHIPS ARE DIFFICULT TO GET SO DON'T GET DISHEARTENED IF YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO GRAB ONE

- > Summer internships are difficult to grab because companies have hardly 2 months to train you and then derive work from you
  >
  > - So, they hire quality over quantity
  > - 6 month interns and FTE (Full Time Employement) are comparatively easier

- From 6th semester, your capstone project will start.
- Capstone Project is a 2-semester long project. It gets graded and perhaps has the maximum credits for a subject. Let me explain the flow
  - Commences from 6th semester
  - Creating a team (4-5 members)
  - Finding a project
  - Finding a mentor
  - Finding research papers associated with it
  - Creating diagrams and initial draft reports
  - Evaluations
    - 2 Mentor evaluations in 6th semester
    - Almost 4-5 mentor evaluations in 7th semester
    - 2 Panel evaluations in 7th semester
  - Preparing a poster in 7th semester
  - Hard binding report in 7th semester
- Tips regarding capstone
  - CHOOSE YOUR TEAM CAREFULLY: Instead of selecting friends who you vibe good with, be with those who will work. Because in college group related projects, there is no accountability. You can do nothing and there is nothing other team members can do (except, I don't know, beating you up if you teamed up with wrong people).
  - CHOOSE YOUR PROJECT CAREFULLY: Professors will be seeking something "novel" for the project you choose however in your third year, you will have other priorities (summer internships, hackathons, CV building, mock interviews (optional)). Choose something which your team members know (and you definitely know). Worst case, your team members might not contribute (because of them being busy due to placements OR any other effect).

## TODO : Fourth Year

- Placements intensive
- You will probably have a placement symposium
  - A quick crash course on what happens in different types of placement
  - Activities are as follows
    - Quantitative Aptitude : Required for initial assessments
    - Group Discussion and Case Studies : Apparent in Non-Tech companies
    - Guesstimates : Really interesting. Usually in non-tech companies but CAN also be used in tech interviews (like system design or estimating memory usage)
    - Personal Interview : Will happen everywhere
  - Attend all sessions. Its fun lol
- Get yourself formal clothes
  - Men : Shirt, Belt, Shoes, Trouser, Suit, Tie (optional)
  - Women : (I don't know lol)
- Capstone Stuff
  - In panel evaluations, wear formal or semi-formal
  - Get your report checked by your mentor
  - Use plagirarism checker provided by library
  - Ensure that your report (at a minumum) has the following
    - Font = Times New Roman
    - Text : Justified
    - Margins : 1 inch on all sides
    - Figures captioned
    - References given
    - For other things, consult your mentor
  - For final panel evaluation, you will need to get your report hard-binded.

# Additional Tips

## Selecting Programming Language

- Usually, General Purpose progrmaming languages (like C++, Java, Python, Javascript etc.) are almost similar and there is no specific advantage in learning either
- Once you know one programming language, you can easily learn others. The knowledge is transferrable

```
- My suggestion : Start from C++ / Java
  - These languages are the old school languages.
  - The fundamentals which you learn from them are applicable to majority of programming langauges
  - Once you are able to learn them, you can pretty much learn any programming language easily
```

- To determine how proficient you are at a language, refer to [THIS](#todo--determining-proficiency-in-a-programming-language)
- Python is a popular general purpose language. See the meme below

![](../../Images_Markdown/Python_Selection.jpg)

- A list of popular programming languages (and their common uses) are as follows

| Language   | Domains                                                                       |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Python     | Machine Learning and Data analysis, Webdev (Django), Automation Scripting     |
| R          | Machine Learning, Data analysis, Statistics                                   |
| Javascript | Web development (Both frontend and backend), Mobile Development(React Native) |
| Solidity   | Blockchain (Writing smart contracts)                                          |
| SQL        | Database                                                                      |

## TODO : DSA vs Development

- DSA is a foundation for development
- You can learn to develop through youtube tutorials, courses etc. HOWEVER what DSA will teach you is problem solving.
- Problem solving is independent of tools used and thus, by having a good base of DSA, you will be able to learn development with relative ease.
- An important aspect of being a software engineer is following good programming practices. Refer to [Resources](#resources)

## TODO : DSA vs CP

- DSA is a foundation for CP
- CP is really good to be indluged in HOWEVER if you are not careful, you may learn a few habits which can later be a hinderance in software development job
- You can be a software engineer with good DSA + good development skills
- Phases to learn CP
  - [Learn DSA](#the-phases-to-learn-dsa)
  - CP Algorithms (https://cp-algorithms.com/)

## TODO : Placements

## TODO : Stuff which every CS student needs to know

| Stuff                        | Importance                   |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Linux                        | Essential                    |
| Linux Command line           | Essential (95% of times)     |
| Github                       | Essential                    |
| Docker                       | Optional / Essential (?)     |
| Vscode                       | Essential                    |
| WSL                          | Highly Useful (Windows only) |
| Windows / Linux Shortcuts    | Highly useful                |
| Stackoverflow                | Essential                    |
| Environment Variables (PATH) | Essential                    |

- Linux is primarily the OS used by developers
  - Linux is an open source Operating System (yes, an open source OS!)
  - Open Source means that the code is available publically and anyone can use the code and improve upon it
  - In simple terms, Linux is a free OS
- There are lots of various "distros" (editions / variations of linux)
