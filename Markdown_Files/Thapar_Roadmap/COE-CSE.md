## Overview

- These are the events which you will experience in 4 years of your engineering in COE (Computer Engineering) and CSE (Computer Science and Engineering)
  - There is no fundamental difference between the two branches
  - Only the order in which subjects are taught is different

| Year | Events                                                                                    |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Emphasis on all around education, basic programming                                       |
| 2    | Data Structure and Algorithms, Buggy Project, Essential Core Subjects                     |
| 3    | Software Engineering, AI/ML, Core Subjects, Capstone Beginning, Summer interns (Optional) |
| 4    | Placements, Core Subjects,                                                                |

## TODO : First Year

- All the engineering branches will be taught the same subjects in this year but in different order
- For example, the subjects which students of Non-CS branches (Civil,Mechanical, Chemical etc) will be studying in first semester will be the same subjects you will study in second semester

- **You are at a stage where exploration is your main goal**

  - There is no need to rush to "Get the 40 LPA package" as said by any random youtuber
  - Neither do you need to hustle for side income or do freelancing. ~~thand rak bc~~ Have some patience (unless your financial situation is really dire.)
  - Build your foundation, determine what excites you and work towards it

- Focus on your academics . [CGPA and Scholarships Section. (Click here)](../Thapar_Info.md)

### Selecting Programming Language

- Usually, General Purpose progrmaming languages (like C++, Java, Python, Javascript etc.) are almost similar and there is no specific advantage in learning either
- Once you know one programming language, you can easily learn others. The knowledge is transferrable

```
- My suggestion : Start from C++ / Java
  - These languages are the old school languages.
  - The fundamentals which you learn from them are applicable to 90% of programming langauges
  - Once you are able to learn them, you can pretty much learn any programming language easily
```

- To determine how proficient you are at a language, refer to [THIS](#todo--determining-proficiency-in-a-programming-language)
- Python is a popular general purpose language. See the meme below

![](../../Images_Markdown/Python_Selection.jpg)

- A list of popular programming languages (and their common uses) are as follows

| Language   | Domains                                                                       |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Python     | Machine Learning and Data analysis, Webdev (Django), Automation Scripting     |
| R          | Machine Learning, Data analysis, Statistics                                   |
| Javascript | Web development (Both frontend and backend), Mobile Development(React Native) |
| Solidity   | Blockchain (Writing smart contracts)                                          |
| SQL        | Database                                                                      |

| Linux Command line           | Essential (95% of times)     |
| Github                       | Essential                    |
| Docker                       | Optional / Essential (?)     |

- Linux is primarily the OS used by developers
  - Linux is an open source Operating System (yes, an open source OS!)
  - Open Source means that the code is available publically and anyone can use the code and improve upon it
- In simple terms, Linux is a free OS
- There are lots of various "distros" (editions / variations of linux)
- Watch This : https://youtu.be/zA3vmx0GaO8

## Some tutorials which will definitely help you out

- A text editor which is used by the professionals : VSCODE (Visual Studio Code). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPqXP_kLzpo

- Vscode Top Tips : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u21W_tfPVrY

- Setting up a basic environment which will allow you to use functions of both windows and linux (limited functions of linux. Basically terminal) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-atblwgc63E

- C/C++ code using Vscode and WSL : **NOTE TO SELF : MAKE A TUTORIAL**
