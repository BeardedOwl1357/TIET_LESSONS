## Overview

- These are the events which you will experience in 4 years of your engineering in COE (Computer Engineering) and CSE (Computer Science and Engineering)
  - There is no fundamental difference between the two branches
  - Only the order in which subjects are taught is different

| Year | Events                                                                                    |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Emphasis on all around education, basic programming                                       |
| 2    | Data Structure and Algorithms, Buggy Project, Essential Core Subjects                     |
| 3    | Software Engineering, AI/ML, Core Subjects, Capstone Beginning, Summer interns (Optional) |
| 4    | Placements, Core Subjects,                                                                |

## TODO : First Year

- All the engineering branches will be taught the same subjects in this year but in different order
- For example, the subjects which students of Non-CS branches (Civil,Mechanical, Chemical etc) will be studying in first semester will be the same subjects you will study in second semester

- **You are at a stage where exploration is your main goal**

  - There is no need to rush to "Get the 40 LPA package" as said by any random youtuber
  - Neither do you need to hustle for side income or do freelancing. ~~thand rak bc~~ Have some patience (unless your financial situation is really dire.)
  - Build your foundation, determine what excites you and work towards it

- Focus on your academics . [CGPA and Scholarships Section. (Click here)](../Thapar_Info.md)
