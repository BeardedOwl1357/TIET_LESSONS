## Overview

- These are the events which you will experience in 4 years of your engineering in COE (Computer Engineering) and CSE (Computer Science and Engineering)
  - There is no fundamental difference between the two branches
  - Only the order in which subjects are taught is different

| Year | Events                                                                                    |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Emphasis on all around education, basic programming                                       |
| 2    | Data Structure and Algorithms, Buggy Project, Essential Core Subjects                     |
| 3    | Software Engineering, AI/ML, Core Subjects, Capstone Beginning, Summer interns (Optional) |
| 4    | Placements, Core Subjects,                                                                |

## TODO : First Year

- All the engineering branches will be taught the same subjects in this year but in different order
- For example, the subjects which students of Non-CS branches (Civil,Mechanical, Chemical etc) will be studying in first semester will be the same subjects you will study in second semester

- **You are at a stage where exploration is your main goal**

  - There is no need to rush to "Get the 40 LPA package" as said by any random youtuber
  - Neither do you need to hustle for side income or do freelancing. ~~thand rak bc~~ Have some patience (unless your financial situation is really dire.)
  - Build your foundation, determine what excites you and work towards it

- Focus on your academics . [CGPA and Scholarships Section. (Click here)](../Thapar_Info.md)

## TODO : Difficult Subjects

| Name                    | Year | Why Difficult                               |
| ----------------------- | ---- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Engineering Mechanics   | 1    | Numericals require practice                 |
| Electrical              | 1    | Numericals require practice                 |
| Optimization Techniques | 2    | Numericals require practice + Lengthy Paper |
| Operating System        | 2    | Theory + Practice                           |
| Compiler Desgin         | 3/4  | Theory + Practice                           |

## TODO : Resources to Study From

- Resources to study are given as follows
- For each youtube link, check the playlist of the channel to see whether they teach what you want
- Tally the syllabus taught in college and the video

1. https://www.youtube.com/c/MKSTUTORIALSbyManojSir/playlists
   1. Engineering Mechanics is pretty well explained
2. https://www.youtube.com/c/DrGajendraPurohitMathematics/playlists
   1. This guy will save your "Numerical Analysis", "Optimization Techniques" and to some extent, mathematics-2
3. https://www.youtube.com/c/MathPod/playlists
   1. Thapar Faculty Youtube Channel
   2. Optimization Techniques
4. https://www.youtube.com/c/GateSmashers/playlists
   1. One of the best channels for Engineering Concepts
   2. OS,DBMS,Compiler and many more
