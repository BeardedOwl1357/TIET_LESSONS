## General Note

- **Do not use these abbreivations in formal speech**

  - Suppose you are talking to a stranger (a linkedin connection, a college fest etc.). Do not directly use these abbreviations unless they start to (or you are familiar with them)
  - They make texting efficient but can ruin your language skills (imagine not laughing to a joke but saying `lol bro` )
- A list of common abbreviations are as follows
- Please keep on updating them. I will be a ~~boomer~~ zoomer soon
